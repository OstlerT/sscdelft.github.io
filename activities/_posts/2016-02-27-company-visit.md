Applied mathematics has many applications in science and industry. Therefore, most of our members
are interested to discover the role of mathematicians within companies and math in industrial processes. 
To stimulate this, the SIAM student chapter organizes company visits. On these trips members of the 
student chapter can broaden their perspective of applicability of math in industry, or find out more 
about interesting opportunities to continue their carrier. For examples of past company visits check 
out the links below.
