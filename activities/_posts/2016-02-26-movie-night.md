title: Movie night 
---

The SIAM chapter of Delft organizes multiple movie nights every year. At the so called M^2 nights (Movie and Mathematics),
we enjoy the beauty of mathematics in movies. We usually order food at the beginning of the gathering; 
however, the chapter also provides some snacks and drinks. The movie nights are announced via the SIAM mailing list for 
members. On previous movie nights we watched following movies:

* [Enigma]
* [The Theory of Everything]
* [21]
* [The man who knew infinity]
